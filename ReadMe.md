How to run:
    -> java Server [port] in terminal
    -> in browser, access localhost:port. /file is optional

Notes:
    -> after page loads, the program will terminate itself.
    -> this outputs the header in an HTML table
    -> does not display requested file. it only outputs the file path of requested file
